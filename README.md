*The Product element contains ProductID, Product Name, Price, Description of the product, Stock available.
*There is also an Exchange Rate API being used which converts the currency being displayed to USD or to INR depending upon the value of currency at the moment.
*There is also a Cart to which the user can add elements by clicking on Add to Cart. The user can add same item multiple times too and the cart can be viewed by clicking on View cart.
